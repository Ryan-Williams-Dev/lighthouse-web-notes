## Callbacks

 > A Higher Order Function is a function that takes another function in order to invoke that function.
 * You can pass around functions as values
 * Passing the value is different to passing the invocation of the function
 * You can even give functions more properties
 * Fundamentally a callback is a function that is called by another function
 * Pass in the function itself, the value of the function, not an invocation of it (i.e the return value)
 *
